General description

Function 2

Function 3

# all_codons function

- The function returns all the codons found in the provided DNA/RNA sequence.
- For function to be executed, user must provide the sequence (RNA or DNA). The `start` argument is an optional offset specifying where in the sequence to start grouping into codons, with a default of 1.
- The output of the sequence is a character vector of the codons found in the provided sequence.
- If the length of the sequence is not a multiple of 3, only the full codons will be returned (the function skips any remaining characters at the end that donâ€™t complete a codon).
- Example usage:
```{r}
all_codons("ATGCGATACAC", start = 1)
```
